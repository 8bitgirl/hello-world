# hello-world
This is my very first repository on Github. This is kind of like my test of function while learning the ways of Github. I am an aspiring programmer and software developer and I'm hoping that I am on the right track to the pathway of success. 

(Celebrationg my very first edit!) ...So a little about myself I am a 18 year old girl who loves to code and has really big goals and ideas surrounding these ideas. BUT, I dont know where to start exactly. I know how to code, but its another thing to create! I hope that ultimately I will be able to fond my way through to the goals I would love to accomplish. 

Be the change you wish to see in the world guys, wish me luck üòå‚ù§
